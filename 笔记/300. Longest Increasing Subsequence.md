300. Longest Increasing Subsequence

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

**Example:**

```
Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4. 
```

**Note:**

- There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
- Your algorithm should run in O(*n2*) complexity.

**Follow up:** Could you improve it to O(*n* log *n*) time complexity?

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLIS(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if(n == 0)return 0;
        int *dp = new int[n];
        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i)dp[i] = 1;
        int ans = 1;
        for(int i = 1; i < n; ++i){
            for(int j = 0; j < i; ++j){
                if(nums[i] > nums[j])dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j]+1);
            }
            ans = max(ans, dp[i]);
        }
        delete []dp;
        return ans;
    }
};
```
